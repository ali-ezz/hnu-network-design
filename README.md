## 🎯 Project Objective

Design and configure a scalable, secure network for Helwan National University’s Phase 1 campus expansion, linking:
- Faculty of Engineering  
- Faculty of Computer Science & IT  
- Faculty of Medicine  
- Administration Building  

Goals:
- Reliable inter-building communication  
- Efficient IP planning & subnetting  
- Secure remote management  
- Dynamic routing & DHCP services

## 🔑 Key Features

1. **Subnetting**: Optimized IP subnets per building  
2. **Switch Configuration**: VLANs, management IPs, secure console  
3. **Routing**: Static + RIP/OSPF for inter-faculty traffic  
4. **DHCP**: Automatic IP allocation with address control  
5. **Telnet Access**: Secure remote device management  
6. **Custom Hostnames**: StudentName-Faculty (e.g., Ali-Engineering)
